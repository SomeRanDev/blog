# Reflaxe/C++ Devlog #1 - CallStack

It wasn't until I started delving into the dreaded `Dynamic` type
that I realized Reflaxe/C++ lacked a proper error reporting system.
Throwing an error doesn't even print a message in C++; it just hangs
for like a minute then exits with a random 12 digit exit code. So before
I continued with implementing a runtime type system with Haxe's `Dynamic`,
I needed to make runtime errors look nicer and track easier for my own sanity.

The first part was easy. Instead of compiling Haxe throws as native C++
throws, I could instead print whatever the Error object was to `std::err`
(with its Haxe position), run `exit(666)`, and call it a day. Simply add a
define to decide whether the user wants native `throw`s or these simulated
ones and it's no biggie... except for the fact that wouldn't be compatible
with try/catch. Ooof.

```cpp
// native throw
throw "my runtime error";

// stderr throw
std::err << "Main.hx:32: my runtime error" << std::endl;
exit(666);
```

It would be nice to ONLY print/display errors on uncaught throws...
achieve something similar to Hashlink's nice error popup system... but
that's just not feasible when generating C++ source code. Oh well, native
`throw`s stay for now, I guess. I'll just wrap everything with try \{ ... \}
while testing.

## The Call Stack Problem

Speaking of errors, taking a look into it made me realize the `haxe.Exception`
class wasn't fully implemented for Reflaxe/C++. It had a bare-bones version made
to help things run riiiiight at the start of this project's development, and now
was the perfect time to finish it. It was all fine and dandy except for `stack`.
A field which provided the `haxe.CallStack` object for the error.

For those that don't know, the [haxe.CallStack](https://api.haxe.org/haxe/CallStack.html)
class is a wonderful debugging class that provides the entire list of calls
made up to that point:

```haxe
trace(haxe.CallStack.toString(haxe.CallStack.callStack()));
```

Similar to the `Exception` class, `haxe.CallStack` had been given a very early
implementation to make things work, and then it was completely forgotten about.
But _unlike_ `Exception`, it was not going to be as fun to complete.

> Ugh. If only C++ had a built in call stack like every other target.

The funny part is, it actually does. With the release of C++23, a new class was added:
[std::basic_stacktrace](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/basic_stacktrace).
Sooooo... I guess time to make C++23 the minimum required version!!

Haha, I wish. Making C++17 the minimum version killed me; going any higher
and this project would be less compatible than the original Haxe/C++ target. X_X

So... time for option 2.

## Making a Call Stack

When you really think about it though, tracking function calls isn't that hard.
After all, C++'s destructors are a great tool for tracking scopes!

Make a class that adds itself to a global stack when constructed,
then removes itself using the destructor. When generating the C++,
create an instance of that class at the start of every function. Pass
it the name of the class + function it's being used in and BOOM,
you have a global stack you can access at anywhere!

```cpp
struct StackTracer {
  static vector<StackTracer*> Stack;

  StackTracer(string cls, string method) {
    // store cls + method
    Stack.push_back(this);
  }

  ~StackTracer() { Stack.pop_back(); }
}

// ---

// some function
void doSomething() {
  StackTracer st("Main", "doSomething"); // will destroy when func done
  // do stuff
}
```

## The Haxe Target Call Stack Experience

To actually implement the call stack, we have to convert our custom stack
data into Haxe's. Thankfully, there's this super convenient hidden class
that exists just for this purpose: [NativeStackTrace](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/blob/development/std/haxe/NativeStackTrace.hx).

> All we gotta do is implement a version of this class with the functions filled
> out in our target's `_std` folder.

```haxe
extern class NativeStackTrace {
	static public function saveStack(exception:Any):Void;
	static public function callStack():Any;
	static public function exceptionStack():Any;
	static public function toHaxe(nativeStackTrace:Any, skip:Int = 0):Array<StackItem>;
}
```

The `Any` types can be replaced with our own target's unique call stack
list type. For example, [C# uses System.Diagnostics.StackTrace](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/blob/development/std/cs/_std/haxe/NativeStackTrace.hx)
and [Python uses an `Array` of tuples](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/blob/development/std/python/_std/haxe/NativeStackTrace.hx).
From there, we implement functions to generate the stack from an exception
or an arbitrary call, and finally we write the `toHaxe` function to convert it.

What was especially interesting was discovering how inconsistent call stacks are
for each target. While Haxe provides an enum for structuring the call stack in
the form of [haxe.StackItem](https://api.haxe.org/haxe/StackItem.html), the
way each case is used is different for each target.

Going to the [Haxe Playground](https://try.haxe.org/#DD7c3724) and clicking between
each target, you can see how the call stack differs drastically:

```haxe
class Test {
  static function main() {
    trace(haxe.CallStack.toString(haxe.CallStack.callStack()));
  }
}
```

<table
  style={{
    display: "block",
    padding: "12px",
    marginTop: "30px",
    overflowX: "scroll",
  }}
>
  <tr>
    <td style={{ paddingRight: "20px", textAlign: "center" }}>JavaScript</td>
    <td className="fakecode-holder">
      <p className="fakecode">
        Test.hx:3: Called from (unknown).main
        (https://try.haxe.org/program/D005409d/run?r=0.5763444059826026 line 92
        column 67) Called from
        https://try.haxe.org/program/D005409d/run?r=0.5763444059826026 line 405

        https://try.haxe.org/program/D005409d/run?r=0.5763444059826026 line 406
        column 3
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HashLink</td>
    <td className="fakecode-holder">
      <p className="fakecode">
        Test.hx:3: Called from haxe._CallStack.$CallStack_Impl_.callStack
        (/home/haxer/haxe/versions/4.3.1/std/haxe/CallStack.hx line 52) Called
        from $Test.main (Test.hx line 3)
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eval</td>
    <td className="fakecode-holder">
      <p className="fakecode">
        Test.hx:3: Called from Test.main (Test.hx line 3 column 35)
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

In fact, most targets only appear to use `Method` and `FilePos` from
`haxe.StackItem`. The rest are for niche cases with certain targets.

This was a nice change of pace from the usual, restrictive nature of
the Haxe API, as this would allow me to make sure the Reflaxe/C++
call stack was as nice as possible.

## Line tracking

While filling out the `StackItem`s, it became clear I'd forgetten something.
Call stacks do not just require a list of functions, but the _exact_ line
they're called from.

Taking a peak into [hxcpp](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hxcpp/blob/c3e5ab85b0c19688f7494ae44909ed4bfc63bdb7/include/hx/StackContext.h#LL170C72-L170C72),
it appears their solution is to do what I've done so far, but also update
the function's stack tracing variable every expression. THAT'S what all those
ugly `HXLINE` do (guess it was kinda obvious).

It wouldn't be too hard to implement that as well... and it's not like
I have much of a choice, but wooooow it destroys the beautiful Reflaxe/C++
code I had so much pride in.

But in the end, I implemented it. All it took was overriding `Reflaxe`'s
`prefixExpressionContent` function and generating content before
every expression was a piece of cake.

## Final Conversion

I was worried about the way local functions would be printed,
but as discussed before, we only need to use the `StackItem`s we need.
Like with the Haxe/Python target, I opted to the `FilePos(Method(...), ...)`
combo for everything.

`Method` allows for any text to be added for the class and function, so
even in rare cases like local functions, I was able to generate a nice,
custom format that stood supreme to other targets:

```haxe
class Test {
  static function main() {
    function a() {
      final b = () ->
        trace(haxe.CallStack.toString(haxe.CallStack.callStack()));
      b();
    }
    a();
  }
}
```

```text
Called from Test.main.a.b (Test.hx line 5 column 3)
Called from Test.main.a (Test.hx line 4 column 2)
Called from Test.main (Test.hx line 3 column 1)
```

## Result

Since Reflaxe/C++ does not use any dependencies, all the code (both the C++
implementation and Haxe externs) is implemented in the `NativeStackTrace`
module.

You can check it out [here](https://github.com/RobertBorghese/reflaxe.CPP/blob/main/std/cxx/_std/haxe/NativeStackTrace.hx)!

Reflaxe's DCE system is powerful; you only pay for what you use.
Unfortunately... it looks like you'll always be using the
`NativeStackTrace` code.

Reflaxe/C++'s once beautiful "Hello World" output now looks like this:

```cpp
void _Main::Main_Fields_::main() {
  HCXX_STACK_METHOD("Main.hx", 1, 0, "_Main::Main_Fields_", "main")

  HCXX_LINE(1)
  std::cout << "Main.hx:2: Hello world!" << std::endl;
}
```

## Opt In Option

In the end, I decided to disable call stack features by default. Reflaxe/C++
is a clean code generator first. Only when a certain define is enabled (`-D cxx_callstack`)
does `haxe.CallStack.callStack()` return the stack. If it's not enabled, an
empty array is returned and a message is printed:

```text
Call stack features must be enabled using -D cxx_callstack
```

Hopefully this intrinsically teaches users the benefits of keeping the
call stack enabled vs disabled. And more importantly, allow me to
advertise Reflaxe/C++ as the prettiest C++ output in all the land!

## What's Left To Be done

I didn't bring up multi-threading support because... I didn't do anything
about it. In the future, I'll need to keep separate call stacks for each
thread. But threads have not been implemented yet, so that's a problem
for future me!

Anyway, that's about it for this log. May you visit again!
